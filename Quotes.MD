# 如何真实

**Provide specific, concrete sensory details**: You can make up an underground tunnel that doesn’t exist, but if you describe the smell of sewage and the persistent dripping of water, you draw your reader into a concrete experience that contributes to the sense of reality.

> *感官描写（或叙述）：让人身临其境*

**Focus on emotions that are true to your characters**: Your hero might be fighting an impossible beast, but everyone will be able to relate to their fear.

> *共鸣情绪：如果你的角色准备面对一个不可战神的怪兽，读者会感同身受的害怕*
>
> *就像，你杀了一个独角兽，观众会难过*

**Incorporate the familiar alongside the unfamiliar**: Keeping the reader grounded in things they recognize is just as important as introducing new and interesting elements.

> *真实和虚构一样重要*

**Avoid technical mistakes**: If you’re writing about the real world, get the facts straight. If you’re writing a magical world, stay consistent with the laws of your creation.

> *虚构世界也有法则*

**Take time to cover objection**s: If something isn't right in your world, let your characters notice that it isn't right for them either.

> *有些事情在真实世界行不通，那么在虚构的世界也行不通*



# 老故事的新角度

Neil suggests many tools for approaching an old story from a new angle.

**Change point of view**: Choose an alternate character to retell a familiar story. In the novel Foe (1986), J.M. Coetzee narrates the tale of Robinson Crusoe from the point of view of Susan Barton, a castaway who washed up on the island in the middle of Crusoe’s adventures.

> 改变视角：以原著中另一个角色的视角，重新讲述故事。

**Modernize themes**: A lot of classic tales get a gender-based upgrade, where an author will delve into a female character’s head from a more modern perspective. Margaret Atwood’s novella The Penelopiad (2005) revisits Homer's Odyssey through the eyes of Penelope and her chorus of twelve maids.

> 现代主题：比如从女性视角讲述故事。

**Switch a story element**: This could mean taking a story to a new location—Cinder (2012) by Marissa Meyer re-imagines Cinderella as a cyborg in Beijing— or changing the type of story—In The Snow Queen (1980), Joan D. Vinge turns Hans Christian Andersen’s classic tale into a space opera.

> 改变故事元素：比如把灰姑娘变成北京的机器人，《白雪公主》改成一部太空歌剧。

**Make it your**s: Take a familiar story and add in a bit of your own background or experience. Mario Puzo did this with panache in The Godfather (1969), bringing elements of Shakespeare’s Henry IV to the world he knew well: Italian immigrants in post-war America.

> 变成你的故事：去一个熟悉的故事，换成你的背景或者经历。比如《教父》，把莎士比亚《亨利四世》的元素，带到他熟悉的战后意大利移民中。
