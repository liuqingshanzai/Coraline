# 如何真实

**Provide specific, concrete sensory details**: You can make up an underground tunnel that doesn’t exist, but if you describe the smell of sewage and the persistent dripping of water, you draw your reader into a concrete experience that contributes to the sense of reality.

> *感官描写（或叙述）：让人身临其境*

**Focus on emotions that are true to your characters**: Your hero might be fighting an impossible beast, but everyone will be able to relate to their fear.

> *共鸣情绪：如果你的角色准备面对一个不可战神的怪兽，读者会感同身受的害怕*
>
> *就像，你杀了一个独角兽，观众会难过*

**Incorporate the familiar alongside the unfamiliar**: Keeping the reader grounded in things they recognize is just as important as introducing new and interesting elements.

> *真实和虚构一样重要*

**Avoid technical mistakes**: If you’re writing about the real world, get the facts straight. If you’re writing a magical world, stay consistent with the laws of your creation.

> *虚构世界也有法则*

**Take time to cover objection**s: If something isn't right in your world, let your characters notice that it isn't right for them either.

> *有些事情在真实世界行不通，那么在虚构的世界也行不通*
